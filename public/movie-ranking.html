<H3>Oh Brother Where Art Thou!</H3>
<p>Hilarious movie set in the old south.  Incredible acting that transported me to that time period and had me invested in the characters.
</p>
<H3>All the "Bond" Movies </H3>
<p>A series of intriguing action movies set in Britain.  I am especially drawn to the display of futuristic imaginative technology. These series of action films can be appreciated by any fan of great action and sci/fi films</p>
<H3>Matrix</H3>
<p>The original "Matrix" film was a thriller.  The use of CGI effects and non-stop action was quite thrilling. The subject matter, an examination of the possible tension between the need for technological advancement, and the potential dangers of the empowerment of 'machines' and the potential for the subjugation of humans to machines, was quite engaging.</p>
